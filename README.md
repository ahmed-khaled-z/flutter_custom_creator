- **Core**: Includes network-related utilities and general-purpose utility functions.
- **Features**: Houses the main application file, dependency injection setup, and the entry point of the app.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use this package in your Flutter project:

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_custom_app:
       git:
         url: https://github.com/flutter-try-catch/flutter_custom_creator
         ref: main
   ```

2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Usage

To create a new Flutter project using this custom app structure:

1. Install the `flutter_custom_creator` tool (if not already installed):
   ```
   dart pub global activate flutter_custom_creator
   ```

2. Use the tool to create a new project:
   ```
   flutter_custom_creator example com.yourdomain
   ```
   Replace `example` with your desired project name and `com.yourdomain` with your app's domain.

3. This will create a new Flutter project with the custom structure and files provided by this package.

4. Navigate to your project directory and run the app:
   ```
   cd example
   flutter run
   ```

### Customizing Your App

After creating your project:

1. Modify `lib/main.dart` to customize your app's entry point.
2. Update `lib/features/app.dart` to adjust the overall app structure.
3. Use the provided config, core, and feature directories to build out your app's functionality.

## Configuration

- Modify `app_router.dart` to set up your app's navigation structure.
- Customize `dark_theme.dart` and `light_theme.dart` to match your app's design.
- Use `app_helper` files to maintain consistent styling and functionality across your app.

## Network

The `core/network` directory contains classes for API communication:

- `api_provider.dart`: Handles API requests and responses.
- `app_endpoints.dart`: Defines API endpoints used in the app.

## Utilities

The `core/utils` directory provides common utility functions:

- `dialogs.dart`: Helper methods for displaying dialogs.
- `logger.dart`: Logging utility for debugging.
- `snack_bar_utils.dart`: Functions for displaying snack bar messages.
- `validator.dart`: Input validation helpers.

## Dependency Injection

The `injection_container.dart` file sets up dependency injection for the app. Modify this file to register and manage your app's dependencies.
